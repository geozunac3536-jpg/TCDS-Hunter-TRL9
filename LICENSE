TCDS Research & Operational License (TCRL-1.0)

with Explicit DOI Separation Clause

1. Scope of this Repository

This repository constitutes the Operational Evidence Layer of the
TCDS Hunter System, corresponding to a validated Technology Readiness Level 9 (TRL-9) deployment.

The primary purpose of this repository is to provide:

auditable operational evidence,

executable artifacts,

forensic documentation,

and deployment-ready system components.



---

2. Explicit DOI Separation and Governance Model

This project is governed by a dual-DOI architecture, intentionally separating operational evidence from canonical intellectual property.

2.1 Operational Evidence DOI (Primary Reference)

DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17923458

This DOI SHALL be used as the exclusive reference for:

TRL-9 validation and assessment,

operational performance evaluation,

forensic post-event analysis,

procurement, deployment, or sovereign acquisition review,

technical audits of executable behavior.


This repository is the live operational node corresponding to that DOI.


---

2.2 Canonical Intellectual Property DOI (Canonical Reference)

DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17520491

This DOI SHALL be used as the exclusive canonical reference for:

authorship and attribution,

paradigm definition and ontology,

theoretical corpus of the TCDS framework,

intellectual property claims and priority.


The canonical DOI does not represent an operational deployment and SHALL NOT be used for TRL assessment.


---

2.3 Legal Interpretation of Differences

Any differences in structure, metadata, scope, file contents, or versioning between:

10.5281/zenodo.17923458 (operational evidence), and

10.5281/zenodo.17520491 (canonical IP ledger)


are intentional, non-erroneous, and legally valid, resulting from a deliberate layered governance architecture.

Such differences:

SHALL NOT be interpreted as inconsistency,

SHALL NOT be interpreted as duplication or misrepresentation,

SHALL NOT invalidate either record.


This separation is designed to reduce institutional friction and enable independent evaluation of execution versus authorship.

3. License Grant

Subject to the restrictions below, permission is granted to:

inspect and audit the code and documentation,

execute the software for evaluation or verification,

reference results for technical or institutional assessment.

4. Restrictions

Unless explicitly authorized in writing by the author:

Commercial exploitation is prohibited.

Derivative works that alter the paradigm or training AI models on the corpus are prohibited.

Re-licensing under alternative terms is prohibited.


This repository is not released under an open commercial license.
